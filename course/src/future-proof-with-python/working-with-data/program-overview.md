# Program overview

_Estimated time: 10 minutes_

---

## Skills

In the next few weeks, you’ll learn to make programs that can:

- Get input from the user, and show them messages
- Work with numbers and text
- Make decisions
- Repeat operations over again
- Work with lists of data

## Final Project Example

At the end of the course, you’ll make a final project of your own design, using the skills you learn in the program.

Here’s a **Guess the Capital** project by a past student that shows the different concepts you’ll learn.

🤔 You don’t need to understand the code of this project yet. Each week, you’ll learn more about how these work in detail. But, for now, you can just have fun with the project and get a sense of what will come later.

In week 1, you’ll learn the basics: **data**, **variables**, **operators**, **input** and **output**.

In week 2, you’ll learn flow control and how to make decisions with **conditions**

In week 3, you’ll learn more on flow control and how to repeat operations with **loops**

In week 4, you’ll learn about storing data in **lists** and do more practice with **loops**

In week 5, you’ll build your final project

## Mindset

Along the way, your mindset will change.

- You’ll be less scared about computers and **more confident** 💪🏿
- You’ll know **how to debug** and find a solution when things don’t work 🐛
- You’ll learn how to **break problems down** into smaller pieces and solve them piece by piece 🧩
- You’ll make friends and **collaborate with teammates** 👥

Let’s hear from some Kibo alumni about their learning journey.
