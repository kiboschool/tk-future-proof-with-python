# Learning with kibo

E*stimated Time: 1 hour 30 mins*

---

In this lesson, you‚Äôll get an overview of how learning at Kibo works, instructions to set up the tools you need, and a brief intro to Python.

## Before you start...

At Kibo we love learning together!

As a tradition, we take a ‚Äúpeakture‚Äù together on zoom!

Kibo is different from other classes you have been a part of.

- Kibo is an online program. That means that **you‚Äôre in charge of your own learning**.
- A lot of the learning is **asynchronous:** you go at your own pace. There is a **weekly live class** everyone will attend, and weekly assignments everyone will submit.
- Get ready for a challenging journey.
- Learning to code takes time! You need to **schedule lots of practice time.**
- We love learning to code together. Once the program starts, you‚Äôll **work with partners and groups**.

We want everyone who enrolls in Kibo to be successful.

Before you can fully enroll in the program, we want to check that Kibo-style learning works for you. You‚Äôll read the following pages and submit two brief assignments.

‚ö†Ô∏è **You must submit the two Replit assignments** to complete your enrollment in the program.

After this Lesson, you will be able to:

- Use **Replit** and **Notion** to learn with Kibo
- Use basic input and output in Python
- Learn about the **debugging** **mindset** for learning to program
