## Leaderboard

The instructors will update this as you complete challenges together. Whenever your squad finishes a challenge, one member should post a message in the “FPWP Community Orientation Leaderboard” thread in the #general channel with your squad number and the challenge that you have completed. We will update the leaderboard based on the information that is posted in the thread.
