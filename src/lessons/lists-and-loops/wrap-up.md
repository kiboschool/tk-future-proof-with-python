# Wrap up

## Summary

- Lists store multiple pieces of data, like `[1, "hello", [ "another list" ], False]`
- You access list elements by their index, which starts at 0, like `my_list[0]`
- You can change list contents by assigning at an index, appending, or removing elements
  - assigning: `my_list[0] = 5`
  - appending `my_list.append(10)`
  - removing `my_list.pop(2)`
- You can solve many problems by updating a variable at each step in a loop
  - total and average
  - maximum and minimum
  - finding and filtering
