# Final project instructions

**In week 5 there are no new topics to learn.** So you’ll focus on your final project, and then work on finishing up the work from the previous weeks and wrapping up the course.

Congratulations on making it this far in your Future Proof journey! It’s been a fun-filled few weeks. Now it’s time for you to put your Python skills to test by building a program of your own design. The final project is a chance to 🙌🏿 **celebrate what you’ve learned** **🎉** and ✨**explore the creativity of coding**.🎨

👥 This is a team project. Schedule time to work on the project together. Teams can be a **max size of 3** people.

If you cannot or do not wish to work with a teammate, you may work on the project alone. If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor.

### Before You Start

- Brainstorm and agree on the basic design for the project before you start coding.
- Use pen and paper to draw out the interactions before you code.
- Work on your project in steps, as we experienced during the course, and make sure you test each part before moving to the next.
- When you need help anytime, **G**o **C**limb **K**ibo 😉

✨✨Have fun!✨✨
