## Individual Project: Guess My Number

**Due date: Sunday Nov 20**

<aside>

💡 This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

### Part 1

🔢 Write a program that asks a user to guess the value of a number chosen between 1 and 99. Let the user know if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.

### Part 2

👩🏿‍💻 Extend your solution to Part 1. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 99, and use a `while` loop to let the user keep guessing until they guess right number.

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
