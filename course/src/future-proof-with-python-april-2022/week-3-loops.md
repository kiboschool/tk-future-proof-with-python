# Week 3: Loops

---

### Intro

We often want code to run again and again, until it’s time to stop. We might need to run part of the program for a certain number of time or as long as some condition is true. In this weeks’s lessons, we will learn how to do that using loops. 

## **Learning Outcomes**

After this week, you will be able to:

- Use loops to repeat code
- Break programming problems into small parts and gradually build up a solution
