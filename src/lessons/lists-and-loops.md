# Lists and loops

---

## Intro

At the end of the last lesson, you saw how the `for` loop gave you the power to loop through a list of items. In this lesson, you’ll learn more about working with **lists**, and see how lists and loops together make for powerful programming patterns. You’ll also focus on problem-solving using loops, and find out how do you break a problem down into pieces so that you can write a program to solve it.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After this week, you will be able to:

- Use lists to store and manipulate data
- Use loops and lists together to solve common programming problems
- Break programming problems into small parts and gradually build up a solution
