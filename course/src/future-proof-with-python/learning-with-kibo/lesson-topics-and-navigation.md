## Navigating the lessons in Notion

Lessons are here in Notion. They will be released once a week on Sunday evening.

Each lesson includes:

- An **overview** page explaining what the week is about
- A page for each of the key **concepts** in the lesson
- A page of **Practice** exercises
- An **Assignment** with details about work you must submit. Your assignments all have due dates.
- A **wrap-up** page that includes a summary of the lesson and a chance for you to give us feedback.
  _Feedback is a gift, and we appreciate hearing from you!_

You can use the top navigation bar (highlighted in the below image) and the links at the bottom of each page, to navigate through the lessons.
