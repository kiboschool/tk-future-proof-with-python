## Individual Project: Guess My Number

**Due date: Sunday May 15th**

<aside>

💡 This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

### Part 1

<aside>

🔢 Write a program that asks a user to guess the value of a number chosen between 1 and 99. Let the user know if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.
**Access** the assignment in Replit here: <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://replit.com/team/kibo-fpwp5/P33-Guess-My-Number" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

### Part 2

<aside>

👩🏿‍💻 Extend your solution to Part 1. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 99, and use a `while` loop to let the user keep guessing until they guess right number.

</aside>

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
