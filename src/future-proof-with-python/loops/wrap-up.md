# Wrap up

## Summary

- `while` repeats code for as long as a condition is True
- `for` repeats code for a specific number of iterations
- `range` lets us control the start, end, and step size of a `for` loop

- You can solve many problems by updating a variable at each step in a loop
  - total and average
  - maximum and minimum
  - finding and filtering
- You can debug loops using `print`, or by stepping through the code with a debugger like pythontutor
