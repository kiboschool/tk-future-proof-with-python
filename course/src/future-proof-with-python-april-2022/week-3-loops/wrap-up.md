# Wrap Up

## Summary

- `while` repeats code for as long as a condition is True
- `for` repeats code for a specific number of iterations
- `range` lets us control the start, end, and step size of a `for` loop
- You can solve many problems by updating a variable at each step in a loop
    - total and average
    - maximum and minimum
    - finding and filtering
- You can debug loops using `print`, or by stepping through the code with a debugger like pythontutor
