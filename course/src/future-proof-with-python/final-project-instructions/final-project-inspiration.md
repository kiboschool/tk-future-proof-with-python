## 1 - Quiz Game

Use a list to store the questions in your code.

- Display each question to the user
- Accept the user‚Äôs answer to the question
- Count the user‚Äôs correct answers (and optionally wrong answers)
- At the end of the game, show the results

**Stretch Goal: Use Remote Data**

Instead of having the questions fixed in code,¬†use a web-based API like [Open Trivia](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to fetch questions and answers for the game. To use the API, select the options you want (e.g., category, difficulty, type) then click ‚ÄúGenerate API URL.‚Äù This will give you a link like [this](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=18&difficulty=medium&type=multiple) where you can fetch questions and answers.

üí° You'll have to do some research to figure out how to get external data. One starting point might be the documentation for the [requests library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).

## 2 - Choose Your Own Adventure Game

Design a text-based adventure game that involves writing prompts, then using conditional logic to branch to different parts of the story.

- Display parts of the story to the user, and prompt them for a decision
- Accept input from the user about their decision
- Show the results of their decisions, and the next choice

See [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-text-games-play-online/) for some examples of text-based adventure games, or try playing [The Dreamhold](https://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/dreamhold/), or [Zork](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq).

<aside>

üí° A list might not be enough for storing the data you need. You might try using a _dictionary_ - another kind of Python data structure, that stores keys and values. You can read the [documentation for dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) to get started.

## 3 - Tic Tac Toe Game

Expand on the Tic Tac Toe game you developed in the live classes to add new features that make the game complete.

Some features you might add:

- Add a start menu with different options
- Add New Game option that handles all **the win scenarios**, and asks users to play another round.
- Add A Previous Games feature, that keeps track of the previous games results.
- Add A Top Score feature, that keeps track of the top score and name of the player who received it.

There‚Äôs lots of creative ways to make the game more interesting and fun to play. Come up with some of your own and try them out!

## 4 - Other Ideas

As long as you are creative and demonstrate all of the concepts covered in the course, you can come up with your own project idea. If you do, remember to message Mohammed to get feedback before you start coding. Other ideas might be:

- Use Python Turtle to draw cool graphics, or make a more visual game
- Write a "Mad Libs" style program that fills in the blanks of a story based on user input
- Design an interactive calculator program
- Make a program that picks words from lists to generate poetry

There are tons of other possibilities, so use your imagination!

## 5 - Examples of Past Student Projects

Here are examples of past student projects, showing what kind of project you can build. Remember, you're not restricted to building a project exactly like these - they are just a starting point.
