# What is a list?

In your life, you‚Äôve come across all kinds of lists - grocery lists, todo lists, the attendance roll at school, the roster of your football team. Lists in Python are a way to represent many pieces of data, like you do on those lists. Instead of just one number, string, or boolean, a list can hold many pieces of data at once.

When working with lists in your life, there are a few core actions you perform:

- Create a list
- Add something to the list
- Remove something from the list
- Change an item on the list
- Take some action for all of the items on the list

In this lesson, we‚Äôll cover the syntax for creating lists and updating lists, and performing these core actions.

## List Syntax

A list is a sequence of values. It‚Äôs written like this:

```python
[1,2,3]
```

The list is surrounded by square brackets, with **elements** separated by commas. The values inside a list are called ‚Äòelements‚Äô or ‚Äòitems‚Äô. You can assign lists to variables, just like you can with numbers and strings:

```python
my_list = [1,2,3]
```

Lists can be empty. An empty list looks like this:

```python
empty_list = []
```

Lists can contain any type of element, even other lists.

Below are some examples of valid lists:

```python
countries = ["Kenya", "Ghana", "Ethiopia", "Zimbabwe"]
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
empty_list = []
foods = [["apples", "kiwis", "bananas"], ["chorizo", "steak", "chicken nuggets"], ["ice cream", "popcorn", "chocolate bars"]]
different_types = [False, 1, "string", []]
```

## The `list` data type

Earlier, you learned the basic Python data types: String, Int, Float, Boolean. A List is another core data type in Python, but it‚Äôs different from the others you‚Äôve learned so far.

```python
my_list = [1,2,3]
type(my_list) # <class 'list'>
```

A list is a type of **data structure**.

<aside>

üìó A **data structure** is a way of storing and organizing data. Data structures are used in programming to organize and store data such that computers can efficiently perform operations on that data.

</aside>

Different data structures are useful for solving different kinds of problems in Python. The other most common built-in Python data structures are dictionaries, sets, and tuples. We‚Äôre going to focus on Lists, but as you grow in your Python skills, you‚Äôll learn the uses of these other types.

### List indices

Each element of the list has a position, called an **index**. We can get an element from a list using the name of the list and its index in brackets. For example, given the list below:

```python
countries = ['Kenya', 'Ghana', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
```

We can access the first list item using `countries[0]`, the second list item using `countries [1]`, and so on.

```python
countries[0] # "Kenya"
countries[1] # "Ghana"
```

Remember that lists are **indexed starting at 0**. So the first item has position 0, the second item has position 1, and so on. This start-from-zero numbering is common to almost all programming languages.

<aside>

üëâüèø **Why do list indices start at 0?**
You can think of a list index as an **offset.** Indexes answer the question:

> _How many **spaces from the start** do I go to find the item?_

![array_indices_explanation.png](/future-proof-with-python/lists-and-loops/list-basics/array-indices-explanation.png)

In this list, you have to move 0 spaces to get to `"Kenya"`, so it is at index `0`. You have to move 2 spaces to get to Ethiopia, so it is at index `2`.

```python
countries[0] # "Kenya"
countries[2] # "Ethiopia"
```

</aside>

After you access an element from a list, you can use it anywhere you‚Äôd use another value or variable.

```python
print(countries[0]) # Kenya
print(countries[1] + " is a nice place to visit") # Ghana is a nice place to visit
```

  ```python
  tallest_buildings = ["Burj Khalifa", "Merdeka 118", "Shanghai Tower", "Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower", "Ping An International Finance Centre", "Lotte World Tower"]

  print(tallest_buildings[0])
  print(tallest_buildings[2])
  print(tallest_buildings[1], "is taller than", tallest_buildings[5])
  ```

## More about list indices

If you try to access a value past the end of the list, Python will raise an error:

```python
print(countries) # ['Kenya', 'Ghana', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
countries[3] # "Zimbabwe"
countries[4] # IndexError: list index out of range
```

To keep from going out of bounds, you can get the length of the list with the function `len`:

```python
len(countries) # 4
```

If there are 4 elements, then the last index is `3`, since we start counting at `0`. The last element is always at index one less than the length of the list.

```python
countries = ['Kenya', 'Ghana', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
last_index = len(countries) - 1 # 3
countries[last_index] # "Zimbabwe"
countries[len(countries) - 1] # "Zimbabwe"
```

Python has a shorthand for accessing elements from the end of the list:

```python
countries[-1] # "Zimbabwe"
countries[-2] # "Ethiopia"
```

Negative indices start counting from the end of the list, so `-1` is the last index, and `-2` is the second-to-last, and so on.

## Changing Lists

Lists are **mutable.** In programming, that means ‚Äòchangeable‚Äô. The order of items in a list and the list items themselves **can be changed**. We can add and remove items, swap items in place, and reorder the list.

We can change any element of a list by assigning at an index. For example, to change the second item in the list above to the `"Nigeria"`, we can assign to index `1`, like this:

```python
# The old list
print(countries) # ['Kenya', 'Ghana', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
# Change the second item
countries[1] = 'Nigeria'
# The new list
print(countries) # ['Kenya', 'Nigeria', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
```

To add a new element to the end of the list, you use `.append()`

```python
countries.append("Cameroon")
print(countries) # ['Kenya', 'Nigeria', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Cameroon']
```

To remove an item from a list, you use `pop()`. With no arguments, pop removes the last element.

```python
countries = ['Kenya', 'Ghana', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
print(countries) # ['Kenya', 'Nigeria', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe', 'Cameroon']
countries.pop() # removes the last element, "Cameroon"
print(countries) # ['Kenya','Nigeria', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
```

Or, you can specify an index to remove, and `pop()` will remove the element at that index.

```python
print(countries) # ['Kenya','Nigeria', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
countries.pop(1) # Removes the element at index 1, "Nigeria"
print(countries) # ['Kenya', 'Ethiopia', 'Zimbabwe']
```
