## Summary

- **Comments** let us put text in a program that will be ignored by the program but are useful for humans reading the program. Comments in Python start with the `#` sign.
- **Variables** are a way to store data with a name, so you can use it later. Creating a variable looks like `name = "Mo"` or `age = 22`
- **Strings** are the Python data type for text, and they look like `"hello world"`
- **Ints** and **Floats** are the Python data types for numbers, and they look like `9` or `0.7`
- Python can use **operators** like `+` to add numbers or concatenate strings
- `print` shows output to the user, and `input` asks the user to type in text

üôãüèø **What‚Äôs a squad rep?**    

Squad reps are students who help to maintain a supportive Kibo community. It‚Äôs a way for you to help your squad successfully reach the finish line of this program.

The responsibilities of a squad rep include things like checking in with squad members every week to see how they are progressing, relaying feedback to the Kibo team, and helping squad members feel like they belong and can rise to the challenge when things get tough.
