# Bonus

_Estimated time: 2 hours_

---

**The practice and project on this page are bonus material. If you finish the required project before the week is up, you should work on them to keep building your Python skills.**

## Practice: Print multiples

<aside>

üìå You should work on this **individually**. If you have questions, post a thread in the **#help-python** channel in Discord. Remember: no spoilers! Use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

</aside>

In this practice, you will write a program that asks the user for a number then prints a statement based on the number the user enters.

## Project: Quick Draw

<aside>

üìå You can work on this project **individually** or **with a team**. The repl has been set up to allow you to create or join groups.

If you want to find someone to work with or you have questions about the project, post a thread the **#help-python** channel in Discord. Remember: no spoilers! Use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

In this project, you'll use the `random` and `time` modules to help you create a game that tests your reaction time. Below is a video of Rob playing the game:

‚úÇÔ∏è **Access** and **submit** the project in Replit here: <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://replit.com/team/kibo-fpwp5/Bonus-Quick-Draw-Project" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

**A note on using Replit for group projects:** the link above will take you to the team page. Scroll down until you see the project then click ‚ÄúSelect project group.‚Äù You‚Äôll see existing groups that you can join. You will also be able to create a new group. Note that you can‚Äôt switch groups after you join, so make sure you confirm your group members (in Discord #help-python) first. If you absolutely need to switch your group, post in Discord and an administrator will help you.
