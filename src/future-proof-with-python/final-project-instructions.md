**In week 5 there are no new topics to learn.** So you’ll focus on your final project, and then work on finishing up the work from the previous weeks and wrapping up the course.

Congratulations on making it this far in your Future Proof journey! It’s been a fun-filled few weeks. Now it’s time for you to put your Python skills to test by building a program of your own design. The final project is a chance to 🙌🏿 **celebrate what you’ve learned** **🎉** and ✨**explore the creativity of coding**.🎨

<aside>

👥 This is a team project. Schedule time to work on the project together. Teams can be a **max size of 3** people.

If you cannot or do not wish to work with a teammate, you may work on the project alone. If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor.

✅ **Requirements**

- You must submit the **Replit** **project** and a **video**, according to the instructions in the Replit.
- Your project must include the concepts you learned in the course.
- Each team member needs to submit an individual repl of their project.

See the **Rubric** in the Replit for more details about what you need to include.

💭 **Get Creative**
There are lots of different programs you could write that meet the requirements. Take a look at some example ideas and past student projects for inspiration for your project:

## How should you work together?

You’ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isn’t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how you’ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when you’ll get together to work on the project.

### Before You Start

- Brainstorm and agree on the basic design for the project before you start coding.
- Use pen and paper to draw out the interactions before you code.
- Work on your project in steps, as we experienced during the course, and make sure you test each part before moving to the next.
- When you need help anytime, **G**o **C**limb **K**ibo 😉
