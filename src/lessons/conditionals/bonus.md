## Project: Quick Draw

<aside>

üìå You can work on this project **individually** or **with a team**. The repl has been set up to allow you to create or join groups.

If you want to find someone to work with or you have questions about the project, post a thread the **#help-python** channel in Discord. Remember: no spoilers! Use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

In this project, you'll use the `random` and `time` modules to help you create a game that tests your reaction time.
