# Wrap Up

## Summary

- Lists store multiple pieces of data, like `[1, "hello", [ "another list" ], False]`
- You access list elements by their index, which starts at 0, like `my_list[0]`
- You can change list contents by assigning at an index, appending, or removing elements
    - assigning: `my_list[0] = 5`
    - appending `my_list.append(10)`
    - removing `my_list.pop(2)`
