- These challenges are best done on a computer.
- After you complete all challenges, submit the feedback form at the end of this page. If you do not submit the feedback form, it will be considered that you did not participate during the Orientation.

If you see a thread with the name **I NEED A TEAM**, this means that the team is incomplete and still needs members. Go into that thread and type **I’m available**. Do not create a new thread if there are still threads that need a team. If all threads are **FULL** and you still don't have a team, create new thread using **I NEED A TEAM** as the name.

Here's what your thread will look like once done
