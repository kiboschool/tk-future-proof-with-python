# What is a program?

Everything you do on the computer has a computer program ‚Äî ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù ‚Äî behind the scenes.

We write computer programs to help us solve problems or perform tasks, like editing documents, browsing web pages, sharing images, or chatting with friends.

## Translating for machines

Underneath the screens and keyboards, computers are mechanical. They only understand 1s and 0s. But, *people don‚Äôt think in 1s and 0s*! When you want something, you use words.

So, how do we tell computers what we want them to do, like ‚Äúsend a message‚Äù or ‚Äúshow this webpage‚Äù? 

We need a **translator**.

*Programming languages let us write instructions for computers using words*. Those words translate into instructions that the machine understands (1s and 0s). Then, we can type something like ‚Äúsend a message‚Äù, and it‚Äôll get translated into something like `00011101001010001 001010010001001 101000010010100 10001010001010100000 01001010010`, which will make the computer send the message.

## A Very Picky Translator

Programming languages are **very picky** about what you type in. You can‚Äôt actually type in `send a message` ‚Äî the programming language wouldn‚Äôt understand! Instead, it would be more like `send_message("Hello!")` . The program has to be crafted precisely, with lots of attention to detail, so that the programming language knows *exactly* what you mean.

Programming languages only understand a **few specific words and symbols**, in a **few specific combinations**. Those words, symbols, and combinations are the **vocabulary, grammar and syntax** of a programming language ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll learn in this course!

# What is Python?

Python is a programming language. You can write Python code, and then it will turn into instructions the computer understands and runs. 

Here‚Äôs a small program that prints out 10 copies of the word ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù.

```python
message = "Programming"
number_of_copies = 10

print(message * number_of_copies) # ProgrammingProgrammingProgrammingProgrammingProgrammingProgrammingProgrammingProgrammingProgrammingProgramming
```

As you can see:

- It uses words, like `message` and `print` and numbers like `10`
- It uses symbols like `=` , `*`, and `()`
- The words and symbols are arranged in a particular order

## What is python used for?

- Python is a **general purpose programming language**, which means it‚Äôs a good fit for a wide variety of problems.
- Python is popular for **data science**, **mathematics**, **web development**, and more. It‚Äôs commonly used for ‚Äúscripting‚Äù - small programs to do specific tasks.
- Python is a widely recommended language for beginners. The syntax is not as hard to get started with as some other languages, and you can build cool, real-world projects with it.

# Basic Python

Over the next few weeks, you‚Äôll learn about Python in more detail. These are just a few topics to get you started:

### 1. Print: Showing output from your program

The easiest way to make your program display some result is to use `print`.

Here‚Äôs an example:

```python
print("This is the output")
```

The program would output:

`This is the output`

- You use the keyword `print`
- Then parentheses
- Inside the `(  )` you put the the value you want to show
- Text has to go in inside quote marks `" "`

To run code and test our programs, we use an online tool called **Replit**. Below is an example of a Replit code file embedded in the lesson.

Click the green play button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to run a program and see the output in the Console box.

üí° Try to change the text between the `" "` and run the program again by clicking the green play button. Notice the output in the Console window.

## 2. More than one print

If you want more than one line of output, you can use more than one `print`.

```python
print("This is line 1")
print("This is line 2")
print("This is line 3")
```

Which would output:

`This is line 1`
`This is line 2` 
`This is line 3`

Try printing more than one line in the code below.

### 3. Variables

You can give a value a name, and use it later, using a variable.

```python
message = "I love programming"
print(message)
print(message)
print(message)
```

`message` is a variable. It stores the value `"I love programming"` . 

The equals sign `=`  assigns the value to the variable.

The program would output:

`I love programming`
`I love programming` 
`I love programming`

Click the green play button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to run a program and see the output in the Console box.

### 4. Adding with `+`

In Python, you can add things together with the `+` operator.

```python
print(10 + 10) # 20
print(10 + 154) # 164
print(12345 + 23456) # 35801
```

Computers are good at arithmetic ‚Äî they are very fancy calculators.

Python can also add text together with `+`:

```python
message = " loves programming"
print("Adesola" + message)
print("Chidi" + message)
print("Ebbe" + message)
```

The program would output:

`Adesola loves programming`
`Chidi loves programming` 
`Ebbe loves programming`

Click the green play button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to run a program and see the output in the Console box.

### 5. Input from the user

Python can ask the user to type in a message using `input` .

```python
favorite = input("What is your favorite thing? ")
print("I like " + favorite + " too!")
```

When the program sees `input`, it prints the message and waits for the user to enter their response. Then, it continues from there.

The variable `favorite` stores the value that the user typed in.

If the user typed in `playing soccer`, then the output would look like:

`What is your favorite thing? playing soccer`
`I like playing soccer too!`

When you run this program, be sure to click in the black ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù box to type a response and press Enter.

## In summary

- Programming languages get translated into 1s and 0s the machine understands
- Python is a beginner-friendly language that has tons of real-world use
- You can make basic programs in Python using `print`, `input`, `+`, and `=`
