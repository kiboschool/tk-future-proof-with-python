## Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this assignment, you'll recreate the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. If you‚Äôve never played before, or need a refresher: two players each choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. They show their choice at the same time. Depending on their choice, there‚Äôs a win, lose, or draw.

- Rock smashes Scissors
- Scissors cut Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- If the two choices are the same, it‚Äôs a draw
- Rock, Paper, and Scissors are the only choices allowed.
